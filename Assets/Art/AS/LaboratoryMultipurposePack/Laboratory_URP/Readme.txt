Hello,
This pack contains the URP version while the HDRP version is available as a lit (free) upgrade.

The use of this asset pack is pretty straight forward: use prefabs or meshes to build your own scenes or begin by modifying the provided Demo Scene.

In the Overview Scene you can find all the prefabs arranged in a grid pattern for easy viewing.

Most of the assets use a custom shader that allows customizing some of the detail elements by tinting the colors based on an RGB mask.

We also provide a standard HDRP or URP version of the materials and prefabs - these files end with the suffix _standard. This ensures full compatibility with any platform supported by HDRP or URP.

The timeline and the animation clips used for the trailer are included.

Thank you for purchasing and we hope youâ€™ll enjoy it!
